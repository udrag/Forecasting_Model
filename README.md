# Linear_Neural_Networks
My first project following the completion of the Course Machine Learning Specialisation on Coursera. In this repository, you will find a Linear Neural Network model built to predict the next day's average temperature in Bucharest.

In this project, you will find 4 functions that:

1. Find the best parameters for a Forest Regressor
2. Using the best parameters to find the best features based on the train data
3. Plots the selected features on a scatter plot to better understand the relationship with the dependent variable
4. Fits a linear regression neural network model.
